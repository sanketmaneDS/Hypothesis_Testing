This repository contains introductory notebooks for basic hypothesis testing problems.

1. A F&B manager wants to determine whether there is any significant difference in the diameter of the cutlet between two units. A randomly selected sample of cutlets was collected from both units and measured? Analyze the data and draw inferences at 5% significance level. Please state the assumptions and tests that you carried out to check validity of the assumptions.

2. A hospital wants to determine whether there is any difference in the average Turn Around Time (TAT) of reports of the laboratories on their preferred list. They collected a random sample and recorded TAT for reports of 4 laboratories. TAT is defined as sample collected to report dispatch. Analyze the data and determine whether there is any difference in average TAT among the different laboratories at 5% significance level.¶

3. Sales of products in four different regions is tabulated for males and females. Find if male-female buyer rations are similar across regions. East: Male=50, Female=550; West: Male=142, Female=351; South: Male=70, Female=350; North: Male=131, Female=480¶

4. TeleCall uses 4 centers around the globe to process customer order forms. They audit a certain % of the customer order forms. Any error in order form renders it defective and has to be reworked before processing. The manager wants to check whether the defective % varies by centre.
